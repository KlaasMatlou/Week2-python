# Python List Operations Task

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates various operations on a list. The script initializes a list, performs several modifications, and attempts to find the index of a specific element.

## Files

* Week_2.py: This file contains the Python code that performs the list operations.
* README.md: This file provides a description of the task and instructions for running the script.

## Task Description

The Python script performs the following operations on a list:

1.  *Initialization:* A list named my_list is initialized with some integer values.
2.  *Appending:* An element is added to the end of the list using the append() method.
3.  *Popping:* The last element is removed from the list using the pop() method.
4.  *Sorting:* The list is sorted in ascending order using the sort() method.
5.  *Finding Index:* The script attempts to find and print the index of the value 30 within the list. It uses a try-except block to handle the case where the value 30 might not be present in the list, preventing a ValueError.

## How to Run the Script

1.  *Ensure Python is Installed:* Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing python --version or python3 --version.

2.  *Navigate to the Directory:* Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the Python script (Week 2.py) and this README.md file.

3.  *Run the Script:* Execute the Python script using the command:
    bash
    python Week_2.py
    
4.  *Observe the Output:* The script will print the state of the list after each operation and the result of the attempt to find the index of the value 30.
